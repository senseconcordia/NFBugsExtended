    description: check if an object is callable using the callable function instead of looking up a call attribute

            perf: Use `callable` instead of testing for `__call__` attribute.
            Should be faster, more elegant. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16388059/using-callablex-vs-hasattrx-call
